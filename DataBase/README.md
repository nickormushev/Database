## Niki's Db
This project aims to create a simple database and implement some functions that most databases have like creating tables, manipulating cells, saving tables to a file, inner join and much more. Once you run the project in your IDE to resceive a list of commands.

## Prerequisites
Just have some sort of IDE that works with c++. This is a uni project so it is just code and does not have any other prerequisites

## Installing
This project does not require an installtion. Just open it in visual studio or another IDE and compile.
Or alternatively use the exe file in the debug directory to run directly.

## Running the tests
There are no unit tests. I made some tests while writing the code to test out my functions but they are not divided.

The test are all bunched up in a single function in the source.cpp file. There you just comment and uncomment them to use them. They are pretty simple but they do the job.
